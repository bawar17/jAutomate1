JAUTOMATE - THE INTELLIGENT GUI AUTOMATION TOOL

JAutomate is a fourth generation GUI test automation tool that will make test automation of a user interface easier and much more reliable. There are now four generations of automated GUI test tools:

1. Position based. Record and replay using fixed coordinates. Worked fine for old command line applications since the screen resolution was fixed and all applications operated in full screen mode.

2. Widget based. Window based applications can have any screen size and location. The GUI widgets are encapsulated to be able to record scripts that are tolerant to changes in the user interface. This fixes the problem with the first generation tools but widget based automation tools are very sensitive to third party or customized widgets. This makes them really inefficient to use unless the application under test was designed with test automation, and the selected test automation tool, in mind.

3. Visual GUI Testing (VGT). Based on image recognition, the test tool can actually visually identify (see) the position on the screen to interact with just like a manual tester. This makes the third generation test automation tools insensitive to both fixed coordinates and implementation details of the user interface. A Visual GUI Testing tool can automate any type of application regardless of framework and operating system used.

4. A Visual GUI Testing tool with a higher level of intelligence. A fourth generation tool uses screen captures instead of smaller images and can use the extra information in order to locate or verify the result. The additional information provided by the screen captures makes fourth generation scripts more reliable and easier to understand. A fourth generation script has a strong resemblance with a manually readable step-by-step instruction.


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

JAutomate is implemented in Java and needs a Java Runtime Environment (JRE).
JAutomate can run in any Java supported operating system, like Windows, Linux, Mac och Unix.


UPGRADING JAUTOMATE

Simply install the new version of JAutomate to the same folder as the existing version of JAutomate.
Your scripts, images and settings will still be available, the setup program will not replace files created by the user.


JAUTOMATE MANUAL

You find the user manual in the docs folder.


JAUTOMATE STUDIO

JAutomate Studio is a powerful script editor with recording capabilities.

Run the "JAutomateStudio.exe" or "runJAutomateStudio.bat" file on Windows and "runJAutomateStudio.sh" on Unix, Linux or Mac to start JAutomate Studio.
